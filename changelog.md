# Aggro-Titans (Release Version Jan. 16)

* Public Mod Release

# Aggro Titans Pre-release Patches

Things that were done right when I thought I was done with the mod as a whole, but almost ended up missing a few things that I forgot to do, extending the original planned release date.

* R1: Further fixing QTE files so QTE inputs register properly.
* R2: Last minute tweaks to gun QTEs.
* R3: Changed cutscene bo4160.
* R4: Tweaked a certain shot for cutscene bo4110
* R5: Fixed Shoot01 in "Restored": Sonic was clipping through the first "Red Circle" QTE graphic.
* R6: Adjusted Supreme's Drone Homing Missile to avoid a bug where the homing missiles and Supreme's counter swipe attack making Sonic unable to parry. Slight update to Supreme's idle animation.
* R7: Updated "Combat Mods" Hmm code option: Added "BossBitConfig.hmm"
* R8: Tweaked a few parameters across several scenes. Reset Supreme's idle pose back to default for the time being.
* R9: Last minute fix to Shoot01 again in "Restored" option where Sonic was clipping through another "Red Circle" QTE Graphic on the 3rd shot during the slow-motion button prompt. Fixed a scene in "Retooled" option where one of the QTE prompt types didn't match. Tweaked an animation for Supreme when parrying his counter spin attack.
* R10: Adjusted "Winglaser\_v1" QTE. Added effects to a Mash QTE that was missing effects in a certain area when Supreme tried to crush Sonic with his hands. Added 4k.usm files for 4k Resolution Support for Cutscenes.
* R11: Adjusted "bo6xxx.pac". I hope it reduces lag during the SS2 transformation cutscenes.

## Aggro-Titans V0.2.1

* New Grand Slam animation for Hyper Sonic skin option when selecting "ParryMiss QTE option".

* Reduced file size for "bo6190.usm". Eggman's scope HUD shows up in Realtime now, but only during Eggman's glasses. The scope P.O.V. still remains pre-rendered for now. I doubt I can get the POV working for Realtime.

* ev1770 and ev5020 use the Beta Super Sonic transformation effects.
* "Boss\_Bit\_Param" was adjusted. 2 attacks from the drone's attack patterns have their order swapped.

* Added some effects to the QTE scene from file "test\_qte\_sample"

* Adjusted "bo6xxx.pac" for the Hyper Sonic skin option as it was an outdated version of what I used for the Monologue mod.
