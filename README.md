Special Thanks to everyone.

Starting out as an ambitious mod for only Supreme to restore and overhaul the supplied content we were given throughout the endgame's final moments. 

After several members of the modding community went under the hood and discovered plentiful unused things that Supreme was unfortunately never given the chance to show off, this mod aims to give full functionality of what was left behind, along with some creative freedom to shake up the fight so that Supreme's animations aren't a complete 1-to-1 with Giganto. 

As of version 1.20 and onward of this mod, "Aggro Titans+" now includes all 4 of the Titans. Updates to Supreme have been made to further overhaul his fight to make it the best it can be while remaining as stable as possible. There's been a lot of adjustments across all the Titans I don't feel like explaining them. To keep a bullet list of what I've done with the mod.

# Giganto (Giant01)
- Super Transformation cutscene got an update to better seamlessly transition to the fight.
- Restored obscure "Super Jump" attack
- Restored unused "Howl" attack
- Slightly overhauled his "immediateActions" parameters and some attack params.
- Phase 2 can now be skippable (in Battle Rush and Master King Trials only)
- Restored some beta elements of Giganto's defeat. (Has a config option)

# Wyvern (Dragon01)
- Road phase slightly faster
- Super Transformation cutscene is updated.
- Super Sonic's death cutscene is updated.
- Restored unused "Light-scratch" attack
- Adjusted attack parameters, Wyvern may counter multiple times.
- Wyvern's Counter Laser has an alternate unused animation that will play if you're on Wyvern's left side. 
- Wyvern's Phase 2 is skippable
- New animation for Grand Slam in Phase 2
- Wyvern may perform a new QTE after the Phase 2 cutscene if you're on Master King's Trials
- Wyvern may perform a different QTE instead of the Missile QTE at a random chance.
- Restored unused Beta animation of Wyvern's defeat with some slight camera alterations at the start for uniqueness. (Configurable)
- Missile QTE has an updated fail animation since this attack is an insta-kill when failed.

# Knight (Knight01)
- Super Sonic transformation cutscene updated, the animation of Knight pulling his sword out has been moved in to the cutscene to start the fight sooner.
- Super Sonic's death cutscene is updated.
- Adjusted "ShieldRide01_Short" QTE
- Adjusted "ShieldRide02" QTE, now has a different animation to stand out.
- Some of Knight's sword attack animations have been adjusted.
- Knight's Phase 2 Grandslam may instead play a QTE that'll deal more damage if successfully cleared all prompts. Failing certain prompts will deal less damage.
- Knight's final QTE has been adjusted to include a restored unused animation of Super Sonic preparing to catch the sword.
- Knight's Phase 2 cutscene is skippable.
- A new QTE will play after Knight's Phase 2 cutscene in Master King's Trials.

# Supreme (Rifle01) {Base Game}
- Restored unused Giganto Clap-Bite QTE (AT_Sp01)
- Restored and updated the animation of unused Giganto Mega Laser QTE (AT_Sp02)
- Restored unused Counter-Blow Attack
- Supreme's attacks are slightly faster.
- Supreme's attack patterns may change midway through Phase 1.
- Restored unused Rifle Dark Shot QTE.
- Updated Rifle Light Shot QTE.
- Updated Supreme's "AT_QTE_NONE" attack. Will shoot 7 homing shots in a single group instead of 8.
- Supreme's Phase 2 Cutscene is now skippable.
- Restored Supreme's unused Wings for Phase 2. (This makes Supreme have a custom model and will not be compatible with certain other mods that contain Supreme's original model, or other Supreme mods with their own model, i.e. Holoska's Supreme Rework.)
- Phase 2 "AT_QTE_NONE" has been updated, will shoot 7 homing shots one-at-a-time, instead of 8 shots in consecutive groups of 2.
- Bitlaser event is converted to a QTE and the prompts may be randomized.
- Supreme's QTE are updated in ways Phase 1 and Phase 2 events will match Supreme's appearance.
- Several unused QTEs have been restored and completed. It's clear the devs had a lot more going for this Titan but time restrictions prevented him from being the best Titan above the rest.
- Unused extended version of Rifle Light Shot QTE has been added in the "Retooled" QTE Preset.
- Unused extended versions of Bitlaser01 and Bitlaser02 have been added in the "Oops All Bitlaser" QTE Preset.
- Brand new QTEs have been made for the fight for an enhanced experience using elements of unused animations throughout Supreme's files.
- 3 QTE presets can be chosen in the settings.
- Restored unused Grand Slam cutscene that Supreme was suppose to have. (Animation made by Schitzo) *Current issues: Grand Slam cutscene does not do damage due to lacking the parameters in the boss file for cutscene damage unlike the rest of the Titans.*
- Super Sonic's death scene has been updated.
